🤖 **A2A Protocol Enthusiasts Unofficial Community**

The [Google Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol](https://google-a2a.github.io/A2A/) is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents. In a world where agents are built using diverse frameworks and by different vendors, A2A provides a common language, breaking down silos and fostering interoperability.


A2AP is an unofficial, open-source community composed of Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol enthusiasts and advocates, dedicated to promoting and practicing this open standard for agent communication.
